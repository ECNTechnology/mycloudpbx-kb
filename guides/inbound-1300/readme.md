An Inbound 1300 service allows customers to call your business from anywhere in Australia by dialling a single, national 1300 or 1800 number.

Your 1300 number can be configured with a number of options.

* **Divert Function:** Divert to landline / mobile.
* **State Based Routing:** Calls can be routed differently based on the location of the caller.
* **Time of Day Based Routing:** Calls can be routed differently based on the time of the call.

This guide will show you how to configure your service.
