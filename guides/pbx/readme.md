## Call Recording Encryption

To comply with data protection regulations and to provide enhanced security, myCloudPBX provides the option to encrypt call recordings with a user provided public key.

### Generating a Public/Private key pair.

To enable call recording encryption you will first need to generate a Public/Private key pair.

To create a Public/Private key-pair we recommend using OpenSSL

**Windows users**

Download OpenSSL for Windows (<https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries>)

To run the commands below, go to the OpenSSL32 directory on your PC, and change to the /bin directory

::: tip 

You may need to open the command prompt with admin privileges (**run as administrator**) and you will need to restart your computer before generating a certificate.

:::

**Mac users**

OpenSSL comes shipped with Mac OS X version 10.6.2 onwards. 

You can use Terminal to run OpenSSL (Open _Applications_ > _Utilities_ > _Terminal_ or search for ‘_terminal_’ using the search bar in the top right hand corner of your screen) run the commands below.

::: tip 

You may need to run each OpenSSL command lines with elevated privileges.
– add _sudo_ before each command as needed.

:::

**Using OpenSSL**

The basics command line steps to generate a private and public key using OpenSSL are as follows:

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout myprivatekey.pem -x509 -days 1825 -out mypublickey.pem
```

::: danger WARNING!
STORE YOUR PRIVATE KEY IN A SAFE, SECURE LOCATION. IF THE PRIVATE KEY IS LOST, ENCRYPTED FILES CAN NOT BE DECRYPTED
:::

### Enabling Call Recording Encryption.

To enable call recording encryption you will first need to log into the https://my.ecn.net.au Portal.

Once logged in, click on '_**My Services**_' and then expand the '_**Voice**_' section.

Select the PBX you wish to enable call recording encryption.

Hover over '_**Addons**_' and click '_**Configure Addons**_'.

Enable the call recording encryption and paste a copy of your _**PUBLIC KEY**_.

Click '_**Save**_'

Recorded calls will now have a “.enc” suffix to identify call recorded with a user provided public key. 

### Decrypting Call Recordings

To decrypt call recordings, use the following command. (Adjust for your filename..)

```
openssl smime -decrypt -binary -in RECORDING_NAME.mp3.enc -inform DER -out RECORDING_NAME.mp3 -inkey myprivatekey.pem
```
