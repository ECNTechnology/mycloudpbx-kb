* **Select Campaign:** When selected, you will be prompted to choose from a list of active campaigns available to you.

On this screen you will be able to see all campaigns available to you.
Use the '**Select**' button to join a campaign and start dialling.

## Campaign Type: Blaster

A '**Blaster Campaign**' is a fully automated outbound campaign with no user agents involved. This campaign will make outbound calls and play an automated message.

The blaster campaign will behave differently depending on if '**Answering Machine Detection**' (AMD) is enabled or not.

### AMD Disabled


<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/blaster_amd_disabled.png">

**Call flow with AMD disabled:**

**1.** Outbound call is placed.

**2.** Call is answered.

**3.** Automated Message is played (CloudDial beep detection continues to run).

**4.** If at any time a beep is detected, CloudDial will begin to play the automated message from the start.

**5.** Once the message has been played to completion, CloudDial will hangup.


### AMD Enabled

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/blaster_amd_enabled.png">

**Call flow with AMD enabled:**

**1.** Outbound call is placed.

**2.** Call is answered.

**3.** CloudDial AMD Detection begins

**4.1** If the result is a '**human**', CloudDial will play the automated message and then hangup.

**4.2** If the result is a '**Machine**', CloudDial will wait until the answering machine message is played and when the beep is detected CloudDial will then play the Automated Message.

### Create a Blaster Campaign



## Call Recordings

::: tip New Feature:
In order to meet PCIDSS Compliance, we have enhanced the call recording functionality to enable an Agent to '**mute**' a recording while taking payment or other personal information.
:::

While an Agent is on an active call, they will be offered the following call recording options:

* **Start/Stop Recording this Arrangement:** When '**started**' the main call recording will continue to run, and a _new_ recording will be started. This enables you to capture just the relevant part of the call into a small file. When '**stopped**', only the arrangement is stopped and the main recording will continue to record.
* **Stop All Recordings:** This will **stop** all recordings, including any arrangements. 
* **Mask/Unmask Recording:** This will mute the audio the recording. (Typically used while taking credit card payments).

## Custom Dialling Order

Based on customer feedback, we have added the ability to choose the order in which the numbers in your campaigns are dialled.

To start you will need to add a column to your campaign list in the numerical order you wish to dial the numbers.

Once you have your contact list created, you can create your new campaign.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-orderedcampaign-1.png">

From the '**Management**' menu on the left hand side, click '**Campaign Management**'.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-orderedcampaign-2.png">

In the top right hand corner click the arrow next to the '**New Campaign**' button and choose '**New Advanced Campaign**'.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-orderedcampaign-3.png">

On this screen you must enter the following information:

* **Campaign Name:** This is for your reference. (Your Agents will see this when they join campaigns).
* **Country:** Choose your country.
* **Dialling Prefix:** This will be your caller ID for your outbound calls.
* **Redial Attempts:** This determines how many times CloudDial will dial the number before giving up.
* **Power Factor:** The number of simultaneous calls dialled in relation as a ratio to the number of active agents on your campaign.
* **Select Contacts:** Use the '**Select**' button to upload your CloudDial campaign data.

Click '**Next**' when complete.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-orderedcampaign-4.png">

The '**Field Mapping**' tab allows you to map custom fields in your CloudDial campaign data into the system.

Match the columns in your uploaded data to the references shown.

::: tip
If you have a specific order you wish to dial the numbers, select that column for the '**Sequence of Call**' field.
:::

Click '**Next**' when complete.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-orderedcampaign-5.png">

From the '**Call Direction**' menu, you can choose between;

* **Outbound:** CloudDial will handle outbound calls only for this campaign.
* **Inbound:** CloudDial will handle inbound calls only for this campaign.
* **Inbound & Outbound:** CloudDial will handle both inbound & outbound calls for this campaign.

From the '**Campaign Script**' menu, you can choose from all of your pre-created campaign scripts. 
These will show for the Agent while on each phone call.

You can also enter in additional notes that will appear on your agents screen while they are waiting for a call.

In the '**Tags**' section you can assign relevant tags to the campaign. This will be used for tag based routing when enabled.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-orderedcampaign-6.png">

Answering Machine Detection (AMD) allows CloudDial to first make sure there is a human answering the phone instead of a voicemail system before bridging the call to an Agent. This can save your Agents valuable time chasing leads instead of leaving voicemail messages.

To enable, check the option to '**Switch on AMD**'.

When AMD is detected CloudDial can either hangup, or leave a pre-recorded voicemail message.

If you have chosen to leave a voicemail message, you will need to select your sound file in the next section before pressing '**Next**'.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-orderedcampaign-7.png">

Here you can add your '**Wrapup Reasons**'.
These will be used by the Agents at the end of their calls to measure their KPIs.

When you are happy with the configuration of the campaign, click '**Finish**'.

## Customise Agent Screens

You can customise the options an Agent has access to with '**Custom Agent Screens**'.

To do this, you must first enable the '**Version 2 for Agent Screens**' feature.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-customagent-1.png">

From the '**Settings**' menu on the left hand side, click '**Preferences**'.

This will open the Preferences window.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-customagent-2.png">

From the list set '**Enable Version 2 for Agent Screens**' to '**Yes**'.

Click '**Configure**' to configure the Agent Screens.

Choose from the list of options you wish to allow the Agents:

Click '**Save**' when finished.

## Skills Based Call Routing

Skills Based Call Routing, allows CloudDial to intelligently route calls to Agents based on their skillset.

### Enable Skills Based Call Routing Globally

To enable this you must first enable '**Tags for Campaigns & Users**' so that we can assign skills as needed.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-customagent-1.png">

From the '**Settings**' menu on the left hand side, click '**Preferences**'.

This will open the Preferences window.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-skills-1.png">

Make sure that '**Enable tags for campaigns & users**' is set to '**Yes**'.

Now we can add tags to our phone numbers. 

### Assign Tags to Phone Numbers

Click on '**Phone Numbers**' on the horizontal menu at the top of the screen.

This page shows you all of the numbers allocated to CloudDial and you can enable / disable them from here.

::: tip
**Pro Tip:** If your number does not show on this list, click the '**Update**' button in the top right hand corner.
:::

Once you have found the number you wish to assign skill tags, click '**Assign Tags**' on the right hand side.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-skills-2.png">

Add as many tags as you need separated by semi-colons.

Click '**Save**' when complete.

Now we can add Tags to our Agents.

### Assign Tags to Agents

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-customagent-1.png">

From the '**Settings**' menu on the left hand side, click '**Manage Users**'.

Click '**Edit**' next to the Agent you wish to modify.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-skills-3.png">

Add as many tags as you need separated by semi-colons.

Click '**Save**' when complete.

Now you can configure your inbound campaign to use skills based routing.

### Adding Tags to New Campaign

Create an '**Advanced Campaign**' as normal.

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial-skills-4.png">

You will now be able to assign your tags to your campaigns on the '**Direction**' tab.

When an inbound call is placed, the call will be routed only to agents who have the skills to take the call.
