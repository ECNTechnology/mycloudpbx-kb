Once logged in, click '**My Services**' and select your Business SIP service from under the '**Voice**' menu.

## Direct or Trunk Mode?

There are a few fundamental differences between **Direct Mode** and **Trunk Mode**.

**Direct Mode** is designed for a **_single endpoint_** such as an Analog Telephone Adapter (_ATA_) or an IP Phone.

**Trunk Mode** is designed to be used with a PBX system, either hardware based such as an NEC SL1100 or a software based solution, such as FusionPBX.
With trunk mode, you will handle options such as voicemail and other intelligent routing on your PBX system.

`If you are unsure which option to select, call 1300 790 111 to talk to one of our friendly staff.`

## Initial Setup

When you log into the [**ECN Portal**](https://my.ecn.net.au) you will need to configure your _Region_ and _Operating Mode_.
