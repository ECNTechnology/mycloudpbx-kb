# Caller ID Passthrough

Inbound calls that divert to external numbers can be configured in two ways. 

1. The caller ID will show the number that was dialled. This is useful when you have multiple numbers so that you can answser the call based on the number dialled.
2. **Caller ID Passthrough**: The caller ID will show the callers number.

By default '**Caller ID Passthrough**' is disabled.
