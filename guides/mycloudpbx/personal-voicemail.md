# Personal Voicemail
----

Each extension has the option to have personal voicemail enabled. This voicemail will only plan if an extension is _**directly dialled**_ (not part of a ring group).

## Enable Voicemail on Extension

To configure voicemail on an extension, click on the <img style="width: 50px; height: auto;" src="/images/pbx-officeandusers-icon.png"> icon from the PBX homepage.

Select the extension you wish to modify.

Scroll down until you reach the '_**Voicemail**_' section.

Here you can set the following information:

* **Voicemail PIN:** This is the PIN you will enter to access the voicemail system.
* **Send Messages to my Mailbox:** When selected, the voicemail will be emailed to the address nominated.
* **Delete messages after emailing them:** When selected emails will no longer be retrievable from your handset and will be only accessed via email.

Scroll down the page and click '_**Save**_' when you are finished.

Your changes are now ready to '**_Apply_**' to your PBX.

Click '**_Apply PBX Changes_**'.


## Accessing Voicemail

To access the Voicemail system, dial **777** from your phone, or press the _**Voicemail Button**_ on your handset if it has one.

The voicemail system will then prompt you to enter your _**PIN**_ followed by the **\#** key.

Once authenticated to the voicemail system, you will be able to follow the prompts to record your personal voicemail messages, and listen to voicemails left for you.
