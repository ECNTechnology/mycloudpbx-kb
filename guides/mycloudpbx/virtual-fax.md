## **Configuring Virtual FAX**

There are three steps to configuring Virtual FAX.

* Enabling the Virtual FAX Plugin
* Enabling outbound Virtual senders.
* Configuring a number for inbound Virtual FAX.

### Enable Virtual FAX

Virtual FAX allows you to have a FAX number with all the convenience of email without needing a traditional FAX machine.

## Virtual FAX Troubleshooting

### Disclaimer

The Virtual Fax add-on is an advanced feature providing the facility to send and receive a fax electronically and have it sent/delivered by email to a nominated Email address. 

The Virtual Fax feature is provided on an as-is basis without warranty or expectation of usability. As the Virtual Fax feature operates over a Voice Over IP network there may be certain circumstances where fax receive fails. 

When this occurs there is no Ability for us to correct, recover or improve the facility. No notification of failure will be forwarded nor do we provide any logging or remedy for such Events. 

## **Failure Notices**

Anytime you send a FAX you will receive a receipt to indicate if the FAX was successful or not.
Each receipt will contain the reason for the failure as well as the message header of the sent FAX.

### Sending Rejected - Invalid Number

### Transmission Failed

- - -

<img style="width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/failed_fax_genericfail.png">

The above failure receipt indicates that the outbound FAX failed after myCloudPBX attempted to send it 5 times.

**Common causes of FAX failure:**

* The FAX number is incorrect.
* The FAX number is unreachable and does not answer the call from myCloudPBX.
* The receiving FAX machine is attempting to use a high speed transmission mode that is not compatible with myCloudPBX.
* The receiving FAX machine is using Error Correction Mode (**ECM**). 

**TIPS:**

* Confirm with the intended recipient that the number is correct.
* Give the number a ring from a mobile and confirm that the number is actually a FAX machine. (In this example the number is not a real FAX number, which is why it failed).
* If possible, have the receiving FAX machine set their transmission speed for both send & receive to **9600bps**.
* If possible, have the receiving FAX machine disable Error Correction Mode (**ECM**).

**More about Error Correction Mode (ECM):**

When there is noise or poor call quality on the FAX call, parts of the transmission may become corrupted or lost in transit.

ECM looks at the data received and will request a re-transmission of the corrupted data until it receives an error free copy of the data. 

When a line is particularly bad, these retransmissions can drastically increase the length of the call, and in the worst case can lead to a failure with a _Communication Error_ being reported by receiving FAX machine.

By disabling ECM, we can increase the chances of the receiving FAX machine accepting the transmission even if some of the data is not perfect due to the interference.
