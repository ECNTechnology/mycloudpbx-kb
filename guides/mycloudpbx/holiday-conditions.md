Give the holiday condition a **Name**. (This is for your reference later).

Add in as many dates that your office will be **closed**.

::: warning
**Note:** The office will be closed for the **entire day and night** selected.

At the bottom of the screen you can choose what will happen on any given holiday.

In this instance we're going onto an '**_Announcement_**' called Voicemail.

Click '**_Save_**' when you're finished making changes.

You will now need to assign the holiday condition to an inbound route.

Click '**_Return to Service_**' to go back to the PBX homepage and select '**_Call Routing_**'.

Scroll down to the page and check '_**Enable Holiday**_'.

Choose from the drop down list the holiday condition you wish to enable.

Scroll down the page and click '_**Save**_' when you are finished.
