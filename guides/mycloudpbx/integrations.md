# Integrations

Integrations allow administrators to capture changes and events actioned via the myECN customer portal or a PBX. 

Using the webhook, external workflows can be called, for example when your client creates a new myCloudPBX extension, creating a callback request inside your CRM for an account manager to complete a wellness check.

A Webhook is a way for 2 applications to communicate and share real-time data. A Webhook works in the same way as an API only in reverse - data is pushed from the application rather than pulled (API).

myECN Integrations can also be used to provide live data feeds to third-party or external billing systems. 

There are two main types of Integrations that can be enabled.

* **myECN Integrations:** These integrations are specific to an account.
* **Service Integrations:** This integration is specific to one PBX.

## myECN Integrations

myECN Integrations include the following:

* Create User
* Delete User
* Modify User
