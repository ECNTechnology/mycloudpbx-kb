# **Blacklisting Numbers**
----

In the event you wish to block a number from calling you, add it to the myCloudPBX Blacklist.

From the PBX homepage, click '**_Blacklist_**'. <img style="width: 50px; height: auto;" src="/images/pbx-blacklist-icon.png">

Click '_**Add Blacklist**_'.

Add the phone number, and click '_**Save**_'.

You will never receive a call from this number again.
